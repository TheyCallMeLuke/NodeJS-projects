# StoryBooks

This is a web application for hosting user stories that I made by following the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY&t=5821s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia

## Features
- Create, edit and delete stories
- Log in through a Google account
- Publish stories for public or private

## Tech stack
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- ExpressJS
- Passport

## What I've learned
- Set up a MongoDB on the cloud
- Routing with ExpressJS
- Using HandleBars for creating HTML templates
- Authenticating and Authorizing by intercepting HTTP requests with Passport
- Managing data in the DB

## What could be improved
- Instead of vanilla Javascript, Typescript could be used for easier debugging
- The HandleBars template engine had some limitations like not being able to send PUT or DELETE HTTP requests to the backend. A workaround had to be used.
Angular or React don't have this limitation
- The UI could be improved
